## INTRODUCTION
Tired of griefers online? tired of those menu modders that destroy your game?
Well we all know by now that you need to change lobby to leave those behind. But What if you are unlucky and get into one with more griefers?

Well I saw online (I can't reliable tell the original mind behind this) you can suspend your game going to task manager wait a bit and re-enabling it to make a pseudo temporal solo lobby. 

Well this script does exactly that, but faster and on a simple click of a key (hotkey).

&nbsp;

## DESCRIPTION
_This simple script targets the Red Dead Online exe file  (RDR2.exe) and suspends it for a x amount of time to help players to get a temporally solo lobby._

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## USAGE

1. Extract the contents on any folder on your pc.
    * _Make sure the main code (rdo_sl.ahk) or it's exe file (rdo_sl.exe) and the settings file (settings.ini) are in the same folder._
2. Execute the main file (rdo_sl.ahk or rdo_sl.exe).
3. In the task bar right click the icon for RDO SL and choose settings.
4. Choose your desired suspension time and hotkeys.
5. Once the game is running, any time you want to suspend it, just use your hotkey and enjoy.

&nbsp;

## NOTES

* The Lobby will eventually get more people, but you'll be alone for a while.
* If you enable the Suspend and Close option the app will run auto suspend the game, wait your defined suspension time and close automaticly. 
* To disable this feature after enabled, you'll need to edit the settings.ini and set the variable snclose to 0 (snclose=0) under the OPTIONS section.
* As this is a very early release, there is no much error control, so please make sure your ini file is present and all values are written. (I'll fix defaults later).
